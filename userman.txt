*Notably* is a note taker program. *Notably* focuses on simplicity and quick usage. 

Notes can be composed by typing, by copy/paste and by drag/drop. The notes are
stored in rich text with html-like format. The format supports functional
links and html, as well as images. Integration with normal desktop services is
provided (web links, mailto links) as far as the platform allows.

*Notably* works on Linux and Windows, and should work reasonably on Maemo.

[[Notes]]
== Notes

*Notes* are the basic focus of *Notably*. These Notes can be grouped 
into *Books*, and they can be marked with *Tags*. You can enter text into Notes
by typing, or by copy/paste. You can paste images into Notes. You can
link Notes to other Notes, and to web pages and email addresses.

[[Starting]]
=== Starting a New Note
You can start a new Note just by typing in the Note display of the main window.
If you save the Note without giving it a title, a title will be made
automatically. The title is made up of the data and time when you save the Note.
You can change the Note title any time you want.

You can also create a new Note by selecting *Note...->New Note*. This will
make a Note title, and insert the words "New Note" as the Note text.

[[EnterText]]
=== Entering Text to a Note
You can type in the editor window part of the main window. You can copy
test in other application, and paste into the editor.

To paste, select *Edit->Paste* from the main window. Or use the shortcut 
keys of your platform (often this is Ctrl-V, but this may be different
on your computer or device, or in your locale).

[[InsertImages]]
=== Inserting Images to a Note
You can insert an image by copying the image in another application,
and selecting *Edit->Paste* in the *Notably* main window. Your normal shortcut
keys should also work, depending on your platform.

[[ScreenShots]]
=== Screen Shots
You can insert screen shot images into a Note by selecting *Special->Part Screen Shot*
or *Special->Whole Screen Shot*. A pop-up message informs you that the screen (or
the part you select) will be copied a few seconds (normally 5) after
you click on the OK button.  You can use this delay time to
make sure the screen looks the way you can it captured. For example,
if you had to minimize another application to run *Notably*, you
can maximize that other application to capture its image.

CAUTION: For *Whole Screen Shots*, the *Notably* window will disappear 
completely from some windowing system. This is normal, it has 
not crashed. It will re-appear after a few seconds.

[[LinkFunctions]]
=== Links in a Note
Notes can contain hyper text links, like most web documents. Clicking
on these links causes different actions, depending on the type of
link. Links can be:

* Links to Web sites. These are the familiar +http:+ links.
Clicking on a link to a web site causes *Notably* to
try to bring up your web browser, and get the browser to display 
the site linked to.

* E-Mail addresses. Clicking on a +mailto:+ link causes *Notably* to try to bring
up your email program, and start an email to the address in the link.

* Links to other Notes. Clicking on a link to another *Notably* Note will
bring up that Note in the viewer.

CAUTION: Before bringing up the other Note, *Notably* may save the current
Note automatically if you have made changes to it. 

[[Inter-Note-Link]]
=== Linking Between Notes
It can be useful to refer to a Note from another Note. You can insert 
clickable links using the *Special...* menu from the main window.

*Special...->Copy Inter-Note Link* makes *Notably* remember
the current Note identifier. *Special...->Paste Inter-Note Link*
will insert a link to that Note in a second Note later. The title of 
the first Note will be inserted as the link text. Be aware that if you
change the title of the first Note later on, this change will _not_ be
reflected in the second Note. The link will still work, but the link
text will be the old one.


[[Books]]
== Books
*Notes* can be collected into *Books* in the database. All of the Notes
marked as part of a Book can then be selected. A *Book* can be exported,
meaning that all Notes in the Book are converted to HTML files,
and linked together with an index. The index is written as
an HTML file (web page) to wherever you want. All Notes are written
to the same directory as the index, and all images are copied to the same
area.

[[Exporting]]
=== Exporting Books
To export all Notes in a Book to HTML format, select *Manage...*
from the main window. Then select *Export Book as HTML*.

This will bring up a dialog asking where you want to save the index file.
Be careful to remember which directory (folder) you put this in. You can
export the book wherever you can write files.

IMPORTANT: The book will contain all Notes marked as part of it, _and all Notes 
that are linked to by these Notes_.

[[Tags]]
== Tags
Tags are useful to show the status of a Note. For example, a Note may be marked
as _important_, or _done_, or as anyting you want. You can add tags to Notes, or 
remove tags from Notes. You can also add and remove your own tags to your databse.

=== Adding/Removing Tags on Notes
To change the tags on a particular Note, select and view the Note. Then
go to the *Note...* menu, and select *Note Tags...*. This will give you
a pop-up dialog showing the tags already on the Note, and all available Tags.

Click on an available Tag to add it to the Note. Click on a Tag already on a Note
to remove it.

=== Adding/Removing Tags on *Notably*
From the main *Notably* window, select *Manage...*. Then select 
the *Tag Editor*. You will get a popup dialog that lets you add, remove 
of change Tags. The Tag name cannot be changed. 

You can change the Tag description, and the Tag icon. Clicking on the icon
brings up a dialog to load a new icon file. 

If you delete a Tag, and re-create a new Tag with the same name, _all references 
to the old Tag will be lost_. The tagged Notes will still be there, but
*Notably* will forget about the deleted Tag references.

[[Searching]]
== Searching and Selecting

*Notably* provides several ways to find Notes of interest to you. You can

* Select Notes with any of selected Tags

* Select Notes the don't have any tags

* Select Notes that are part of selected books

* Select Notes that are not in any books

* Select Notes based on a combination of membership in books and labeling 
with tags, or the lack thereof.

* Search for Notes containing words.

* Search for words in a Note.


[[Build]]
== Prerequisits

To build and run *Notably*, the current version uses:

. C++
.. Gcc or Visual C++
. Qt4, including these parts:
.. Core
.. Gui
.. Sql
.. WebKit

For all features of *Notably* to work properly, you need Qt4.6.1 or better,
although most features work with Qt4.4 or better. This only affects you 
when you build the program from source code. If you downloaded a Windows
installer package, you don't have to worry about this.

=== How to Build

It's pretty straightforward. Please read the INSTALL file that comes with
the source code.
