must already have unpacked the archive.

By building and installing Notably, you agree to
the licensing conditions in LINCENSE.txt, and
you agree that you respect all Copyrights involved.


Requirements
============

You need:

* a C++ compiler
* make (Gnu make will work)
* Qt 4.6.1 or later (NOTE: Qt GUI Framework Edition will NOT work!)
  - qmake (or qmake-qt4)
* sh-compatible shell, such as bash

Build
=====

as any user, run:

$ sh build.sh

This will tell you whether the build worked or not.


Install Executable
==================

Depending on where you want to install the executable program,
you may need to have administrative privileges to do this:

# sh install.sh

will install into /usr/local/bin

or 

# sh install.sh /your/choice/of/directory/for/executable

will install where you tell it to. 

In either case, the destination directory must already exist.
